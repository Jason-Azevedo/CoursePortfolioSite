          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Jason Azevedo, I was born here in South Africa and I love
            programming, ever since a child I was interested in games and more
            importantly making them.
          </p>
          <p>
            I started to learn programming in order to make games however once I
            started I realized that I like programming more than all the other
            aspects of game dev and that led me to web development.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am not strictly focused on web dev but interested in it as well as
            mobile app development, which I will soon be getting into!
